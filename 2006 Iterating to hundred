    using System;

    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Read the integer from user input
            int startNumber = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

            // Use a for-loop to print numbers from the given number to 100
            for (int i = startNumber; i <= 100; i++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(i);
            }
