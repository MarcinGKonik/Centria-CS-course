/* Exercise description
    Section 1

Implement a program that asks the user for numbers(the program first prints "Give numbers: ") until the user gives the number -1, When the user writes -1, the program prints "Thx! Bye!" and ends.

Give numbers: 
> 5 
> 2 
> 4 
> -1 
Thx! Bye!

    Section 2

Extend the program so, that it prints the sum of the numbers (not including the -1) the user has written.

Give numbers: 
> 5 
> 2 
> 4 
> -1 
Thx! Bye! 
Sum: 11

    Section 3 

Extend the program so, that it also prints the number of numbers (not including the -1) the user has written.

Give numbers: 
> 5 
> 2 
> 4 
> -1 
Thx! Bye! 
Sum: 11
Numbers: 3

    Section 4

Extend the program so, that it prints the average of the numbers (not including the -1) the user has written.

Give numbers: 
> 5 
> 2 
> 4 
> -1 
Thx! Bye! 
Sum: 11
Numbers: 3
Average: 3.666666666666

    Section 5

Extend the program so that it prints the number of even and odd numbers (excluding the -1).

Give numbers: 
> 5 
> 2 
> 4 
> -1 
Thx! Bye! 
Sum: 11
Numbers: 3
Average: 3.666666666666
Even: 2
Odd: 1
