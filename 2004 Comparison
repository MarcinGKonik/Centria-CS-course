/* Exercise description

Write a program that reads two integers from the user input. If the first number is greater than the second, the program prints "(first) is greater than (second)." If the first number is less than the second, the program prints "(first) is less than (second)." Otherwise the program prints "(first) is equal to (second)." The (first) and (second) should always be replaced with the actual numbers given by the user.

A few examples of the expected behaviour:

> 8 
> 4 
8 is greater than 4.

> -3 
> 5 
-3 is less than 5.

> 1 
> 1  
1 is equal to 1.   */

// Solution

namespace Exercise004
{
    using System;

    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Read the first integer from user input
            int firstNumber = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
            // Read the second integer from user input
            int secondNumber = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

            // Compare the two numbers and print the result accordingly
            if (firstNumber > secondNumber)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"{firstNumber} is greater than {secondNumber}.");
            }
            else if (firstNumber < secondNumber)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"{firstNumber} is less than {secondNumber}.");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"{firstNumber} is equal to {secondNumber}.");
            }
        }
    }
