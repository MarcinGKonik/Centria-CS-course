/* Exercise description

The exercise comes with a template that prints the following:

Days to summer:
100
Hours to lunch:

Coding is fun:
Are you sure?

Change the values of the variables, so the program will print

Days to summer:
200
Hours to lunch:
3.5
Coding is fun:
It sure is!

Do not change anything else, only the variable values!  */

  using System;
  public class Program
  {
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      int dayCount = 200;
      double hoursToLunch = 3.5;
      string statement = "It sure is!";
      // DO NOT TOUCH THESE!
      Console.WriteLine("Days to summer:");
      Console.WriteLine(dayCount);
      Console.WriteLine("Hours to lunch:");
      Console.WriteLine(hoursToLunch);
      Console.WriteLine("Coding is fun:");
      Console.WriteLine(statement);
