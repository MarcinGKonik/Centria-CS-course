/* Exercise's Task
The basic structure of a program is given in the exercise:

using System;

namespace Exercise001
{
    class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Add your code here:
            
        }
    }
}

The line \\Add your code here: is a comment. The composer does not compose it, so you do not have to worry about it. You can remove it, if you want.

Create a program that writes the text Hello World! into the console. The program contains the basic structure pictured above. */

//Exercise solution

namespace Exercise001{
public class Program {
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }
}
}
