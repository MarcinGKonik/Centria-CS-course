/* Exercise description

Create a program which asks for two integers. The program should tell which of them is greater. If they are equal, that should be noted, too.

Give the first number!
> 3
Give the second number!
> 2
The larger number is 3!

Give the first number!
> 3
Give the second number!
> 4
The larger number is 4!

Give the first number!
> 3
Give the second number!
> 3
They are equal!    */
